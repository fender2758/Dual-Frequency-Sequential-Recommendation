# Dual-Frequency-Sequential-Recommendation


Transformer-based sequential recommender system have achieved strong results across a wide range of next-item prediction tasks. However, most advances have been calibrated to sparse interaction logs. As modern platforms accumulate dense histories with higher coverage and co-occurrencerates, self-attention exhibits low-pass characteristics that degrade separability among items displayed within the same impression set. In this paper, we present DuFTRec a sequential recommendation model specifically designed to handle dense user-item matrices. The proposed model introduces density aware spectralattention. Sequences are decomposed into low-and high-frequency components, each learned with band-specific self attention, then fused by a density-conditioned gate to avoid scale mixing. This design preserves fine-grained signals in dense interaction matrices and strengthens separability within impression sets. Our model consistently improves top-ùêæ ranking quality(e.g., NDCG@K,HR@K) over strong Transformer baselines in dense regimes while maintaining competitive complexity.
